**Club** **Cents**

Welcome to the third sprint of our project, Club Cents, a Tennis Club Membership Application! This sprint marks another step forward in our journey toward creating a software solution for managing recreational club memberships.

**Project** **Description:**

Our project focuses on managing membership for a small tennis club, allowing easy registration and payment for practice sessions. Members enjoy flexibility with refunds for cancellations made 24 hours in advance. The system handles rent payments for the club's meeting hall and coach compensation based on attended practices. Timely reminders keep members informed about upcoming sessions, enhancing overall club management
